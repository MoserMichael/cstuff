From time to time there are some goodie scripts that I would like to share; 
(actually i put up my environment + some more goodies for bash scripting [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv) )
Maybe you might find something interesting within this collection:

[here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv/blob/master/README.md) are the instructions to set all this all up.

There are also a lot of vim customization [vim customizations & addons](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv/blob/master/VIMENV.md)

anyway, i am now writing less in this blog. i got to think that it is better to set up separate git repos dedicated to some particular subject. 
At least we can now make an unlimited number of smaller repos (that wasn't the case when i started this project).

Also it seems seems that things have changed a bit since I started this blog (some nine years have passed already).
I am not sure if it me who has changed or if it is the world around me that changed: Nowadays I am more weary to state my opinions under my own name, I am now feeling a need for self censorship, I didn't have that impression back when I started this blog.
