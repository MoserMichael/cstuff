From time to time there are some goodie scripts that I would like to share; 
(actually i put up my environment + some more goodies for bash scripting [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv) )
Maybe you might find something interesting within this collection:

[here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv/blob/master/README.md) are the instructions to set all this all up.

There are also a lot of vim customization [vim customizations & addons](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv/blob/master/VIMENV.md)

anyway, i am now writing less in this blog. i got to think that it is better to set up separate git repos dedicated to some particular subject.
