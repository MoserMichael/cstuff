From time to time there are some goodie scripts that I would like to share; 
(actually i put up my environment + some more goodies for bash scripting [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv) )
Maybe you might find something interesting within this collection:

[here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv/blob/master/README.md) are the instructions to set all this all up.

There are also a lot of vim customization [vim customizations & addons](https://github.com/MoserMichael/myenv/blob/master/VIMENV.md)

anyway, i am now writing less in this blog. i got to think that it is better to set up separate git repos dedicated to some particular subject. also I didn't figure out how to add a certificate to these github pages, I am a bit suspicious that the owners of github will junk this concept of github pages at some stage.
At least we can now make an unlimited number of smaller repos (that wasn't the case when i started this project).
