I have been learning the machine learning course by Andres Ng; [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)

I had to write down my lecture notes, as I have been learning while commuting by train. Here are [my lecture notes](https://github.com/MoserMichael/cstuff/releases/download/0%3B01/ml-pdf.pdf)


Also wrote down my notes on the best book on computer networks: Networking on TCP/IP Illustrated,Volume 1 The Protocols W. Richard Stevens [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/cstuff/releases/download/0%3B01/stevens-protocols-notes.pdf)

(have to admit it tha I still don't quite understand ipv6 after all these years, have to learn it some day)
