### some lecture notes

This page will be silently updated with any new stuff that I am picking up along the way:

I have been learning the machine learning course by Andrew Ng; [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)
I had to write down my lecture notes, as I have been learning while commuting by train. Here are [my lecture notes pdf file](https://github.com/MoserMichael/cstuff/releases/download/0%3B01/ml-pdf.pdf) - link to pdf file.

Also I learned the following tricks in the process:
* I did the notes on Libre office writer; it turns out that it has a working formula editor with a very nice syntax; Microsoft word is not usable for this purpose, as its formula editor keeps crashing.
* Also Libre office has a very nice feature - it can save a document as PDF file (I think MS Office doesn't know how to do that); 
* in github you can produce a binary release for a project that contains these pdf files (of course we know that it is a no-no to add binary files to a git archive), the blog in turn can link to these pdf files; this trick saves me the headache of having to reformat everying in markdown and then having to figure out where this mess fails to display properly. This way this blog becomes even more locked down on the github platform (three cheers for github!!!)
* (i hope they will not pull another trick here, like the forced transition from redcloth to markdown markup. At least writing most stuff as a pdf will not make a difference when they do)
* Some meta observations: most of the notes here are divided into nested lists, this helps me to come up with a more concise representation of complicated syntax structures; In a way this is similar to lisp with nested s-expr syntax; s-expr syntax is more concise than Algol like languages, however it creates problems for programs developed by large teams over a long period of time. Now maybe the whole point of s-expr/lisp is to teach another mode of thinking – by programming in lisp you train your mind to think in more abstract patterns! (it takes a lot to overcome the initial hurdles though – that is another reason why it so far didn't turn into a mainstream programming langauge)

Also wrote down my notes on the best book on computer networks: Networking on TCP/IP Illustrated,Volume 1 The Protocols W. Richard Stevens [pdf notes here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/cstuff/releases/download/0%3B01/stevens-protocols-notes.pdf) - link to pdf file.

(have to admit it tha I still don't quite understand ipv6 after all these years, have to learn it some day)

lately I had to do some work with Java, and noticed that a lot of code uses the stream feature of java8; so I had to learn this nice application of monads. Here are [my notes on the subject](https://github.com/MoserMichael/cstuff/releases/download/new-stuff-learned/java-streams-monad-example.pdf)

I came across a nice explanation of how bitcoin and this blockchain thing works; so here are [my notes on the subject](https://github.com/MoserMichael/cstuff/releases/download/new-stuff-learned/bitcoin-how-it-works.pdf)
