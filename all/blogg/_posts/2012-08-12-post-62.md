<br><br>Is the US Military budget as high as 10% of countries GDP ?<br>The Soviet Military budget was estimated also somewhere around 10% of the GDP.<br>Now lets all start the countdown for the big financial implosion (Tm)&nbsp;<br><br>Sources:<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175361/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175361/</a><br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/31/world/soviet-military-budget-128-billion-bombshell.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/31/world/soviet-military-budget-128-billion-bombshell.html</a><br><br>Now Mr. Romney is said to be all for increased military spending ;<br>The current holder of the office is also a big spender.<br>Good luck U.S.A you will be missed.<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney</a>
&quot;He favors substantial increases in military spending, and has promised to invest more heavily in essential military weapons programs and to increase the number of active-duty military personnel. ... &quot;<br><br>Interesting article: they say the before the Cuba Crisis the Soviet Union did not try to match the US military might; So it is fair to say that it all went downhill for the SU, starting onward with Cuba.<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mo-budget.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mo-budget.htm</a><br><br>&quot;Khrushchev had consistently regarded the growth rate of the Soviet economy, the improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people, as important an index of the growing power of the Soviet cause as Soviet military might. He has been willing to live with long periods of strategic inferiority so as to promote the country&#39;s economic growth. For example, between 1955-1958 he had secured a decline of two billion rubles in military spending, with the savings diverted into investment and consumption, and thereby enabled the Soviet GNP to increase annually by seven percent. This is not to say that Khrushchev has neglected the defense sector; he has in fact led the pack of reformers in remolding the Soviet armed forces for nuclear warfare of his military program; cutting back the conventional arms of service to offset the great cost of advanced weapons and to nourish the economy was the other part of his scheme.<br><br>The collapse of the Soviet strategy to put missiles in Cuba seems to have generated a strong current of opinion in favor of increasing the defense establishment&#39;s share of the country&#39;s limited resources.&quot;<br><br>So funny, the the last thing to be considered for cost cutting is Military spending. Its this trap that all empires fall into ... &nbsp;&lrm;Another common theme is that the real cost of defense is not known by the public, with lots of hidden expenses here and there that all add up, Ups.
