<br><br>I want to quote a youtube comment:<br><br>&quot;Malkmusianful&nbsp;<br>The song that invented psychedelia.<br>If some person tried to seriously argue that Jefferson Airplane codified acid rock/psych rock with &quot;Surrealistic Pillow,&quot; I&#39;ll lead them to this song. Late 1965-early 1966 when this was recorded. Back them, the Dead were just another covers band that played 10-minute jams, the Airplane were another folk rock outfit that sang about marijuana use, and Hendrix was still playing blues for the most part.<br>A white blues band from England codified psychedelia. Wow.&quot;<br><br>&#39;Shapes of Things to come&#39; I think they are singing about the &#39;Singularity&#39; (also known as the &#39;Geek rupture&#39;) ;-)<br><br>&quot;Soon I hope that I will find,<br>Thoughts deep within my mind.<br>That won&#39;t displace my kind.&quot;
