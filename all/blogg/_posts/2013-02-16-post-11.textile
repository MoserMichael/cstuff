<br><br>Interesting page where one can compare OECD countries by such indicators as health, education, salary, housing etc. etc. Did you know that Israel and Russia have the same level of civic engagement ? Both are close to zero ;-)<br><br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/israel/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/israel/</a>

 Why are other countries better of ? In the US people think that they can talk to their local representative, and that the representative is supposed to actually listen to what is said.
 
Probably the system of local representatives creates the notion that there is a well defined contact point to what is going on in higher places.

In Israel the member of Knesset / Parliament come from their respective party lists; so one needs to be part of a major political party in order to have a voice, major parties tend to hold primary elections or something of that sort, minor parties don't do that.

As for the listening part, Israelis have a problem with that. So there is no use in trying.

Or maybe it is the age of the country; democracy in other countries evolved over a very long time frame; maybe feedback mechanisms that allow for input from below are things that need time to grow. Even more so; these mechanisms are probably governed by customs and not by binding laws (pooh says Crustimoney Proseedcake); So lets examine the issue in another two or three hundred year ...
