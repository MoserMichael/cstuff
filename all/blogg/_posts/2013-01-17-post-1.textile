The Chief Rabbi of Israel says that bailouts are not Kosher and against Jewish Religious law. Business owners must be held responsible for misconduct.

This step does not change how the court views the issue, but I think it is very bold to make such a statement.

I wish him well ...
I hope that the powers that be will not try harm our wise Chief Rabbi, as our establishment tends to be a very spiteful one
