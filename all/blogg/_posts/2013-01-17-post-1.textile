The Chief Rabbi of Israel says that bailouts are not Kosher and against Jewish Religious law. Business owners must be held responsible for misconduct.

This step does not change how the court views the issue, but it might make a moral difference for some businesspersons of Jewish descent. I think this statement required some courage on the part of the Chief Rabbi.

I also added a comment:

I wish him well ...
I hope that the powers that be will not try harm our wise Chief Rabbi, as our establishment tends to be a very spiteful one
