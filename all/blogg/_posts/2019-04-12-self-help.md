This page will be silently updated with any new stuff that I am picking up along the way: (I don't want to put up a new page for every new note, and it is much easier to put it down as a pdf file)

I have been consuming quite a lot of TED talks recently; Now TED talks are very feel-good, that's their problem:

ee this Quora discussion [Are the TED Talks a type of church for atheists?](https://www.quora.com/Are-the-TED-Talks-a-type-of-church-for-atheists)

Answer by Bjoern David Paulson: 
“... The actual problem comes when the aggregate sum of pop science is billed as something transformative. The problem arises when viewers come for the enthusiasm and reassurance and confuse that with actual understanding. When the hard questions are left behind and all that remains is a comfortable euphoria”

I hope that keeping notes while listening can get you past the feel good effect, it also leads you to searching for more information if a given topic has caught your interest.
