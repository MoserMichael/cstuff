<br><br>Ups. the cable companies set top boxes eat more electricity than a refrigerator. &nbsp;<a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/us/26cable.html?_r=3&amp;ref=general&amp;src=me&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/us/26cable.html?_r=3&amp;ref=general&amp;src=me&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;</a><br><br>But i don&#39;t understand: how is it &nbsp;that the set top box in my home is not heating up like crazy ? I guess the device uses less electricity in bursts, but then this adds up if it is always left turned on.&nbsp;In any case: be aware of the fire risk, home electronics are a major cause of fires, especially beware of faulty extension cords, its better to add a few more wall outlets. That&#39;s what they do at work in the office, the reason for this, turns out is fire safety. <a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.usfa.fema.gov/citizens/home_fire_prev/electrical.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usfa.fema.gov/citizens/home_fire_prev/electrical.shtm</a>
