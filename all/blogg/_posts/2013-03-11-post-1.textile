The UK has "seven social classes":http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22007058 that's what I call progress - the Indian caste system has only five castes.

Interesting facts about "social mobility":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Country_compariso

In the US and UK there is a low level of social mobility - if you are rich then your kids will be rich; 

Also: in countries high level of income inequality there is lower social mobility.

Now social inequality tends to sharpen over time ; maybe the noted exception here are a few socially oriented countries in northern Europe, but the tendency exists. This development leads to a lesser degree of social mobility, and inevitably to ingrained inequalities of the education system. All that can lead to a weakening of democracy and to curtailment of civil liberties.
