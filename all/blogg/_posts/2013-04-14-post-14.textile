<br><br>Is it only me who thinks that nowadays they could have run into problems with the lyrics?<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWyVPV2Q4RQ" rel="nofollow">STEPPENWOLF - POWER PLAY</a><br><br>Some say that cold war period was sort of more liberal in terms of civil liberties (in the western hemisphere) than what we have now:&nbsp;<br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175638/tomgram%3A_jon_wiener%2C_ike%27s_dream%2C_obama%27s_reality/#more" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175638/tomgram%3A_jon_wiener%2C_ike%27s_dream%2C_obama%27s_reality/#more</a><br><br>One of the problems that they could have run into in our days is here <a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/02/why-anti-authoritarians-are-diagnosed-as-mentally-ill/" rel="nofollow">http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/02/why-anti-authoritarians-are-diagnosed-as-mentally-ill/</a><br><br>Of course there are children and adults with genuine problems that can be helped by medication; the problem that the article tries to point out is that the psychiatric definitions are covering a wide spectrum and are subject to interpretation; the result of this interpretation may over time result in repressive practices.<br><br>I am speculating along these line: maybe back in the past there was a time when sort of every move was measured against the ideological enemy of the cold war; &nbsp;In these times there was a strong disincentive in the west against a wide definition of psychological disorders, namely the Soviet practice of supressing dissent by psychiatric means<br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_abuse_of_psychiatry_in_the_Soviet_Union" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_abuse_of_psychiatry_in_the_Soviet_Union</a><br>The repressive tool here too was a wide definition of a pathological condition&nbsp;<a class="ot-anchor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggishly_progressing_schizophrenia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggishly_progressing_schizophrenia</a><br><br>Now maybe this disincentive was gone, together with the Soviet Union;&nbsp;<br>It might be that we West needs an Ideological enemy in order to uphold the torch of freedom, for moral high values.<br><br>On an related/unrelated note: If one compares the practices of the former GDR with those of the former Soviet Union; in the GDR they had repressive practices down from elementary school; the express desire was to filter out undesirable personalities, so that those would not get into university and get an education; see the regime was very frightened of its intellectuals. Maybe with time such a approach/filter might be repeated in a less liberal age and time.<br><br><br>Disclaimer:<br>Not all of my screws are tight, but whose are ?<br><br>And yes, here are the lyrics of the song:<br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>&quot;Power Play&quot; by Steppenwolf<br><br>What gives you the right? Hey you<br>To stand there and tell me what to do<br>Tell me who gave you the power?<br>To stop me from livin&#39; like I do<br><br>Remember if you plan to stay<br>Those who give can take away<br>Don&#39;t bite the hand that feeds you<br><br>Just one time I&#39;d like to be somewhere<br>Where none of your clever lies fill the air<br>I&#39;m tired of your frozen smile and your voice of tin<br>Just might all gang up on you, turn the knob and do you in<br><br>Remember if you plan to stay<br>Those who give can take away<br>Don&#39;t bite the hand that feeds you<br><br>This never ending power play<br>&#39;Tween jealous greed and vicious hate<br>Is grinding us like giant millstones<br>But it can&#39;t be our only fate<br>It&#39;s time we got our heads together<br>And let &#39;em know that we&#39;re awake<br><br>Those in the dark, you know they&#39;re no longer blind<br>They&#39;re breakin&#39; from your strangle hold on their minds<br>Those who can see don&#39;t need no one to cross the street<br>Be careful who you&#39;re pushin&#39; round, they just might find you obsolete<br><br>Remember if you plan to stay<br>Those who give can take away<br>Don&#39;t bite the hand that feeds you<br><br>What gives you the right?
