Interesting project: they want to make Lisp usable by formatting it as if it where Python: the level of indentation would take the meaning of the level of bracket nesting. "The Readable S-Lisp expression project":http://readable.sourceforge.net 

Now some people like me can't get used to pythonic indentation, but others might find that this is a great feature that could enable Lisp to jump into the 21st century.

h3. Another interesting input format

The concepts of graphical programming languages so far has not been a great success, however here is an interesting combination of graphical elements and text based syntax ; the "Boxer programming language":http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Boxer here the graphical element (the box) is used as a substitute for syntactic construct: drawn boxe are used instead of scope delimiters (begin ... end , { .. } etc ). 
 
This has the utility that there are fewer occasions for syntax error."A report on Boxer":http://www.soe.berkeley.edu/boxer/20reasons.pdf

I find that the subject of alternative input formats is a very interesting one.
