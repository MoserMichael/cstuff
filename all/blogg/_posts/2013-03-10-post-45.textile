<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://fbreader.org/" rel="nofollow">http://fbreader.org/</a> - slower, best user interface (can click on items in table of contents)<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html</a> - faster but less usable (can&#39;t click on items in table of contents)<br><br>Also surprise, surprise, Adobe acrobat is not that bad as a book reader for PDF files ! In the View menu, select the &#39;Read Mode&#39; option (or Ctrl+H), and voila !<br><br>Now for years I was suffering from the default mode of viewing PDF files, which splits up the text into pages; Navigation between the pages is a bit edgy, so longer texts are hard to read that way. Interesting if other people have a similar experience - some useful feature hidden in a behemoth program, and this non obvious feature only makes the whole thing usable.
