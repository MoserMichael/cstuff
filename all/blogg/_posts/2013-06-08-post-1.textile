The NSA has a huge surveillance program called "PRISM":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) ; now a key point of the program is a large "call data base":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_call_database (story was "first reported here":http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order ); Here is what Mr. Schneier has to "say on the subject":http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/what-we-dont-know-about-spying-on-citizens-scarier-than-what-we-know/276607/ .

This call database contains records on all calls that have been made between two telephone numbers. A record contains the following data:
 * phone number of the caller and the destination of the call
 * time and duration of the call.
 * location data from where the call has been made.

If things are viewed from a data processing perspective than it is possible to understand the following; (Disclaimer: my theories might also be wrong, I am not an expert in the areas of Security or law and order)

The real value of a call database is that it can be used to build a "social graph":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph . A social graph consists of nodes: each telephone number (standing for a person) is a node in the graph; two nodes are connected if there has been a phone call between two phone numbers; a connection between two nodes in the graph is called a link in the graph. It is possible to assign attributes to links: if there have been many calls then the attribute that shows the strength of link gets a higher value; timing and activity of calls can also be assigned weights, so that recent calls are of higher value, etc. etc.

A social graph shows exactly how individuals who make up society as a whole are interconnected. If a political movement has a leader, then the social graph can show the following

* what is the immediate circle of contacts around a leading personality
* what is the larger cluster of persons who are influenced by the leader person; this is achieved by following the immediate circle contacts and then the contacts of the contacts, etc.
* what is the intersection of different clusters of interest; this could mark the degree how certain movements influence one another.
* what are the dynamics of influence: did a leader manage to gain a wider following, what was the time frame when influence was acquired. etc. etc.
* Malcom Gladwell's "Tipping point":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point argues that social movements are usually initiated by a small number of persons, by those who tend to make a difference 
<blockquote>
The success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts. ... the 80/20 Principle, which is the idea that in any situation roughly 80 percent of the 'work' will be done by 20 percent of the participants.
</blockquote> 
Clustering of the social graph can identify persons with unusually high level of connectivity / activity. These persons can then be identified and could be targeted for further influence. One can create a 'Who is Who' database of multiplier persons who could wield a wider influence.
* It is possible to apply statistics / machine learning algorithms in order to extract significant clusters from the data; this would effectively create a map of society; A dossier on every person is feasible.
* Location data can track the movement of subscribers; it is possible if a given person has taken part in a protest action or not; it is possible to know if a person has attended a public meeting; Lots and lots of possibilities, and it is all data that can be used in court against a plaintif.

Lots of things are possible with such data; it is of course also a question of cost vs benefit, we don't know what measures were actually implemented in the end. We also don't know what kind of data was gathered from the big technology companies. I know that law enforcement organizations like to extend their scope, just because of the possibility and out of institutional interest. The question of oversight and accountability is crucial, but these are obviously lacking; the NSA anual budget is "estimated around 10 billion $":http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/07/news/economy/nsa-surveillance-cost/index.html, so the possibilities are huge.

Is this knowledge effective at fighting terrorism? I don't know; terrorist organizations are very sectarian; it should therefore be relatively easy to figure out a wider circle of connections that originate from a close nit circle of suspects. Of course tracking a defined small circle costs a fraction of what is required to track the whole population;

It might be argued that sweeping surveillance measures are needed in order to monitor "sympathizers" of terrorist movements. I don't know, not so long ago back the 1970ies, West Germany had the problem of left-wing "RAF terror":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction , "special laws were passed":http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radikalenerlass the state reacted by monitoring suspected radicals; some "3.5 million individuals were investigated and 10,000 refused employment":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_student_movement#The_effect ; meaning they were not allowed to work as civil servants . For a democracy, that's quite a lot of papers turned, the West German state was worried about infiltration, it was worried that leftists would implement a "long march through the institutions":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudi_Dutschke and gain positions of influence in the bureaucracy.

I don't know is such a level of surveillance justified by the current level of insecurity, is this the real state of the union?

Is it all about policing of internal dissent, about monitoring movements like the "occupy movement":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement ? Might be, but I guess that would not be too constitutional.

Lots of questions here, not too many answers are forthcoming.

 In the 90ies they had rumors about the "Echelon":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON program; the system was rumored to record every phone conversation, etc. etc. these rumors where bullshit; the NSA cannot have computers that are light years away from what is widely available. What they can have are storage capabilities that are the largest ones by any number. The NSA cannot currently decode and transcribe all calls in real time on a preemptive basis; the technology to do so is probably not there. But we might get there, in the end.
