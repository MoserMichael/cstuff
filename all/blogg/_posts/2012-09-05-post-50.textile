<br><br>The Vasa was a battle ship that sank on its maiden voyage - sort of a symbol for bad design .<br>... it was all politics &quot;Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, who was leading the army on the continent on the date of its maiden voyage, was impatient to see it join the Baltic fleet in the Thirty Years&#39; War; at the same time, the king&#39;s subordinates lacked the political courage to discuss the ship&#39;s structural problems frankly or to have the maiden voyage postponed. An inquiry was organized by the Swedish privy council to find personal responsibility for the disaster, but in the end no one was punished for the fiasco. &quot;<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)</a><br><br>I think the subject matter would make a great play, epic theater production, controversial and always up to date ;-)
