<br><br>I am deeply shocked; e-book readers call back home, so they know what and how you are reading stuff. E-book readers as instruments of surveillance :-( <a class="ot-anchor" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304870304577490950051438304.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304870304577490950051438304.html</a><br><br>The PC was once an open tool; so they came up with all those closed gadgets that are supposed to replace the PC; And the irony is that all of them are running Linux or BSD ;-)<br><br>... somehow GPLv3 starts to make sense now; an I thought it was too restrictive when it came out ;-(
