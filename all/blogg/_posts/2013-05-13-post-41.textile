Less frequent sources:

"Fourmilog":http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/ very interesting book reviews.
"Philg's blog":http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/
"The Rolling Stone / politics section":http://www.rollingstone.com/politics it has its bias, but Matt Taibbi writes there.
"Bruce Schneier's blog":http://schneier.com - on computer security and beyond.
"Tom Dispatch":http://www.tomdispatch.com/ it has its bias, but I like this publication for its contrarian style.
