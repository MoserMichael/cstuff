Biblical matters

My comment to this discussion http://chronicle.com/article/Biblical-Blame-Shift/138457/

The historian/archaeologist Ian Morris argues that rulers prior to the first Millennium BC were claiming divine legitimacy [1]; If during the Bronze age a Pharaoh decides to kill all Jewish infants, then ordinary Egyptians would see this as an act of heaven. This means that religiously motivated totalitarianism as understood now was the norm, not the exception during this age and time.
 It is strange that this notion would not be not known to a professional historian.

 Also: there can't be a distinction between political and religious conflicts if the rulers are gods or god-like; here any political conflict is a religious conflict as well. If ruler A pays tribute to ruler B then the gods of ruler A are subordinate to the gods of B; so much for "divine translatability" ... 

 More so, Monoteism becomes a prerequisite for concepts such as morality and truth, Morality and individual responsibility can't be combined with the notion that the ruler is your total owner; by rejecting the totalitarianism of the early civilizations (hochkulturen in german) Judaism indeed created the opportunity for a great Humanization of the Axial Age.
