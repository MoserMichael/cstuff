<br><br>I suspect the purpose of the last years gmail redesigns was to make the product less usable on purpose;&nbsp;I guess they are paying a lot for storage of old data and abandoned accounts - and all that did not quite pay off with more targeted advertising;&nbsp;guess the click-through rate on gmail adds is low so they want to minimize costs. fewer users would mean less storage costs.<br><br>And they have all sorts of transient user data from the chrome browser, the auto-completion thing phones back home; they are not obliged to keep this data, but it is good enough to create an online profile ....<br><br>Bruce Schneier says that we are sort of vassals of the big internet companies; I guess that comes with an implied condition - if we got out stuff for free, then people are ready to trade in stuff like &#39;privacy&#39; ... things change when people feel that they don&#39;t get their share of the deal....<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/feudal-security/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/feudal-security/</a><br><br>Google doesn&#39;t want to do evil; what if a new Pharaoh will lead this great house and what if he decides differently? &nbsp;Suddenly one might see all sorts of companies exchanging user data, all in order to create a richer experience for the Customer and his friends ...
