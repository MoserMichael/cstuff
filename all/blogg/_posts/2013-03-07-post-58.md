[Why the west rules -- for now](http://www.amazon.com/Why-West-Rules-Now-Patterns/dp/0312611692)

A very interesting book - it explains the big picture of history; how to interpret what is known about history in terms of the following metrics: Extraction of energy; Social complexity; ability to wage war; how to explain the ups and downs (i.e. periodic breakdown of society - like in the story Nightfall by I. Asimov );Â <br><br>Another Asimov analogy - this book reminds me of the kind of reasoning that was behind psychohistory - the fictional science in the Foundation series.

I would have thought from the title that the book is arrogant western crap; no it isn't , just the opposite.

more on the fictional [Psychohistory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional))

In another fascinating development, it turns out there is a new area of study that does mathematical modeling of historical dynamics [Cliodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliodynamics) . Science fiction is turning into science, fascinating.
