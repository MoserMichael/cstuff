What about substance induced psychosis? 
Why is this problem always ignored in this kind of discussions ?

"Substance induced psychosis":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance-induced_psychosis

The war on drugs might be a failure; but the cost of having
to deal with psychotic / schizophrenic patients might well blow up the health system. Aren't you willfully misguiding the public by ignoring this problem?"
