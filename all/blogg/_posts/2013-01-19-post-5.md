<br><br>This song reminds me of the upcoming election<br><br>&quot;So!<br>Come on ye childhood heroes!<br>Won&#39;t you rise up from the pages of your comic-books<br>your super crooks<br>and show us all the way.<br>Well! Make your will and testament. Won&#39;t you?<br>Join your local government.<br>We&#39;ll have Superman for president<br>let Robin save the day.&quot;<br>Jethro Tull<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9JEPeeohYs&amp;t=18m09s" rel="nofollow">Jethro Tull - Thick as a Brick full</a><br><br>In the word of Janis Joplin: &quot;This is a song of great political importance&quot; ;-)
