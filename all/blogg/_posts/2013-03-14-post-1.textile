Oooo! Object oriented programming in Bash shell; what a bold project.

"oobash project":http://sourceforge.net/p/oobash/code/937/tree/oobash/docs/

every programming language can have its own object system (maybe with the exception for qbasic :-)

Lisp has the common lisp object system ("CLOS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System )

some people wonder if C++ is worth the effort ( "C++ FQA":http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/ )

One can always do Objects in C with abstract data types and function pointers instead of virtual functions; i suspect that the real 'killer feature' of C++ is that one can do objects with fewer keystrokes. 

C++ templates are sort of awful; D seems to have a better template definition ( "link":http://dlang.org/template.html )
