<br><br>A beautiful song&nbsp;<a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2xODjbfYw8" rel="nofollow">Who knows where the time goes - Fairport Convention</a><br><br>(Ups, google wants to do paid audio streaming, now probably all those music videos on youtube will be gone; what a shame <a class="ot-anchor" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22542725" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22542725</a> &nbsp;)<br><br>&quot;Who knows where the time goes&quot; by Sandy Denny<br><br>Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving<br>But how can they know it&#39;s time for them to go?<br>Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming<br>I have no thought of time<br>For who knows where the time goes?<br>Who knows where the time goes?<br>Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving<br>Ah, but then you know it&#39;s time for them to go<br>But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving<br>I do not count the time<br>For who knows where the time goes?<br>Who knows where the time goes?<br>And I am not alone while my love is near me<br>I know it will be so until it&#39;s time to go<br>So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again<br>I have no fear of time<br>For who knows how my love grows?<br>And who knows where the time goes?
