This ever changing post is about Music

----------------------

For me this is the ultimate Rock & Roll song of my generation; 

"Аквариум Этот поезд в огне":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1nAnLzcfrY

It's very much about the end of Soviet / post soviet periods.

Still, for me the essence of Rock & Roll music is deep introspective but nevertheless nihilistic bitching; For me the crisis of Rock & Roll goes hand in hand with this approach: it gives relieve to the ailing soul, but it does not give answers. I can see this clear in the "interview with Boris Grebenchekov":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_THqHI5y2KI

Here is my translation of the lyrics:

This Train's in flames by "Boris Grebenshikov":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Grebenshchikov

Colonel Vasin got back the frontline
He took along his young wife
Colonel Vasin gathered his troops
and declared 'let's get back to our homes
We're already fighting for seventy years 
And they taught us that life is a battle
It's the Intel that established as fact
Those who we fought were of our own'

This train is in flames, and no levers are left to pull
This train is in flames, and there's no place to run to,
This land was ours, and then we got trapped in the fight
As no-mans land	it will perish; time to return it to ourselves
    
Saw generals in high places
They eat and drink our death
Their kids all go crazy
Cause there's nothing for them left to want
And the land is left corroded
And churches are mixed in dust
If we want to that there's some spot to return to
Then now is the time to come home"

Torches burn all around us
Demised troops are summoned up
And people who shot our fathers
Make plans to finish off with our kids
We were born to the sound of the marches
They menaced us with gaol
But enough of the grovel
We already returned back to home

This train is in flames, and no levers are left to pull
This train is in flames, and there's no place to run to,
This land was ours, and then we got trapped in the fight
As no-mans land it will perish; time to return it to ourselves

A beautiful song "Who knows where the time goes - Fairport Convention":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2xODjbfYw8 ; Some see this band as part of the "Cantebury scene":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_scene ("here":http://www.yourcanterbury.co.uk/leisure/fairport_convention_celebrate_45_years_in_the_business_1_1359660 it is mentioned as such) I find it all very amazing; they are not just banging on the instruments, I mean they are real musicians ...


<notextile>
<br><br>&quot;Who knows where the time goes&quot; by Sandy Denny<br><br>Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving<br>But how can they know it&#39;s time for them to go?<br>Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming<br>I have no thought of time<br>For who knows where the time goes?<br>Who knows where the time goes?<br>Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving<br>Ah, but then you know it&#39;s time for them to go<br>But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving<br>I do not count the time<br>For who knows where the time goes?<br>Who knows where the time goes?<br>And I am not alone while my love is near me<br>I know it will be so until it&#39;s time to go<br>So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again<br>I have no fear of time<br>For who knows how my love grows?<br>And who knows where the time goes?
