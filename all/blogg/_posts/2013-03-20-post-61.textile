<br><br>Interesting discussion &quot;How long would slavery have lasted in the South if the confederate states had been successful in seceding?&quot;<br><br><a class="ot-anchor" href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2013/03/07/how-long-would-slavery-have-lasted-in-the-south-if-not-for-lincoln/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2013/03/07/how-long-would-slavery-have-lasted-in-the-south-if-not-for-lincoln/</a><br><br>Quoting JamesJ:<br>.... I don&rsquo;t think the war was necessary, the industrial revolution was eliminating the need for slaves , and was steamroller that would have eventually changed the South as it did everything else. The epic battle that Lincoln fought to save the Union gave the Federal Government the power over States&rsquo; rights we have never recovered from, and while he may have freed the slaves, he enslaved us to the Federal Government, which now is into almost every aspect of our lives, and puts down any dissent with quick brutal efficiency.<br><br>Quoting Brian Gulino:<br>I am struck by how appealing it is to have an underclass. Men in societies where women are oppressed resist progressive movements involving women&rsquo;s rights. It&rsquo;s nice to have half the population serve you. We in California enjoy the services of diligent and hardworking Latin Americans, working at reduced wages due to being illegal. We are loathe to give this up. And our tech company executives flock to Washington to insure a supply of intelligent Asians who can only remain in the U.S. at their behest.<br><br>Then we come to slavery, the crack cocaine of human exploitation. How wonderful it must have been to own slaves. We never would have given it up.
