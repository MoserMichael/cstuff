Could one trade his share for some other goods ? did they have to stand in line for their share ? What happens if they run out of beer ? What kind of society is that that has to mandate the consumption / distribution of stuff to its subjects ? If you run away from Mesopotamian rule and get into Egypt, how would things be different ?<br><br>Maybe this Pelevin guy is not too far off when he likened Soviet / post Soviet society to Mesopotamia ? ... and more intriguing - are these all questions unique to persons who grew up behind the Iron curtain ?
