Is rationing of food a feature of a high-end state? "Ian Morris says":http://www.amazon.com/Why-West-Rules-Now-Patterns/dp/0312611692 that high-end states needs a standing army and needs a huge number bureaucrats, vassals are cut out of the deal and are subordinate to the state (no fiefdoms allowed);  Of course the financing of these projects requires the state to raise taxes. (“Taxes in the ancient world”:http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v48/n28/AncientTaxes.html )

However this development is associate with King Tiglat Pileser the III of Assyria, who lived in the eight century BC;

Can it be that the Mesopotamia of 3000BC was not so much different from the Neo Assyrian Empire of 800BC ?

------------

Another idea: The Pharaohs claimed to be Gods but the rulers or Mesopotamia claimed to be God like; Some people like "Daeniken":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_D%C3%A4niken make a lot out of this distinction.

Can it be that this difference is due to the fact that in Mesopotamia power was usually local to the city state, in any event a subject could possible run away to a competing authority. So the power of the city state could not have been absolute; so there was no use to claim the impossible - it would be strange for a local leader to claim to be God when there is a competing leader next door to you.

In ancient Egypt was much more limited in this regard; there were fewer places to run to, for an individual the choices were severely limited, no use to question established believes.

In any events there is a lot of room for speculation in these subjects.
