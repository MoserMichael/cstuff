I am trying to make some sense of the news that come out of Russia and the Ukraine ; now here is my attempt to sum up what i have heard: So i have been listening to the to radio: "Echo of Moscow":http://echo.msk.ru/ and other news outlets.

Mustafa Dzhemilev on the reasons behind Russian intervention in the Ukraine ( see radio interview "here":http://echo.msk.ru/sounds/1317438.html ) ; the Russian establishment is very afraid of a possible revolution, afraid of events similar to those that happened in the Ukraine. An so they decide to push their neighbor into turmoil, all in the hope that this action will set an example, this is what should deter Russians from repeating such an exercise at home.

Dmitry Bykov says something quite similar in his poem ( "here":http://ru-bykov.livejournal.com/1929699.html )

At least this makes sense; However that would look like an over-reaction on the part of Russia's rulers. With a strong economy fueled by high oil prices there would be few causes for widespread popular unrest. Add to this that many Russians associate political change with social upheaval and anarchy; Putin's regime is still seems to be within the consensus.

There must have been some strong trigger that necessitated strong actions on the part of Russia's rulers; i guess the Moscow "mayoral election of 2013":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_mayoral_election,_2013 has been a deep shock to the establishment and this is what has put them into panic mode;

In these elections opposition parties picked up some 40% of the vote. I guess it showed that at least in Moscow they managed to question the status quo. It is no longer enough to control the media and to rig the election procedure; nowadays social media has a wide reach, grassroot activists can be organized as local election monitors, now this makes vote rigging much more difficult.

Also the current wave of restrictions try to put some limits on bloggers; this is new - they take them on as a serious threat.

h3. alternative explanations

Alexei Venediktov says that Putin wants to leave his mark onto history; I doubt that; the price tag is very steep, so (like capital flight, a worsening of relations with the rest of the world; economic crisis, requirement of possible realignment towards China - with a possible future dependence upon a potential regional opponent); i think a rational politian would not risk all that, unless there is a real or perceived threat that has to be countered.

h3. wider implications

They also managed to seriously piss off a large number of people in the Ukraine; this does not serve Russian interests well. (however i doubt that Putin and his friends were aiming at soft power, i think they are not familiar with the concept)

I find it surprising that all these actions that are supposed to strengthen the rule of the current establishment are achieving the opposite result: capital flight will cause an economic downturn; with a bad economy people will then raise the question of Putin's legitimacy.

I guess inaction (or rather effortless action, Wu-Wei) were not an option here; as always there is too much at stake for those who are in power ...

If this analysis is true, then Russian objectives are of a limited nature (for now) - this means no ground war. i guess that would be a positive element.

(personally i am glad to be watching at all this from far far away).

A municipal election turn into an important event - on condition that a society is standing at a turning point. The East German municipal elections of 1989 were such a moment (big article in German "here":http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wende_und_friedliche_Revolution_in_der_DDR#Gezielter_B.C3.BCrgerprotest_gegen_Kommunalwahlf.C3.A4lschungen )

I guess that this did not escape Mr. Putin, who was a KGB officer stationed in Dresden. This is often described as an unimportant outpost, whoever Dresden was a center of the opposition movement, so Mr. Putin must be very much aware of all this...
