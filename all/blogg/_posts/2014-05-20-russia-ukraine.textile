I am trying to make some sense of the news that come out of Russia and the Ukraine ; now here is my attempt to sum up what i have heard: So i have been listening to the to radio: "Echo of Moscow":http://echo.msk.ru/ and other news outlets.

Mustafa Dzhemilev on the reasons behind Russian intervention in the Ukraine ( see radio interview "here":http://echo.msk.ru/sounds/1317438.html ) ; the Russian establishment is very afraid of a possible revolution, afraid of events similar to those that happened in the Ukraine. An so they decide to push their neighbor into turmoil, all in the hope that this action will set an example, this is what should deter Russians from repeating such an exercise at home.

Dmitry Bykov says something quite similar in his poem ( "here":http://ru-bykov.livejournal.com/1929699.html )

At least this makes sense; However that would look like an over-reaction on the part of Russia's rulers. With a strong economy fueled by high oil prices there would be few causes for widespread popular unrest. Add to this that many Russians associate political change with social upheaval and anarchy; Putin's regime is still seems to be within the consensus.

There must have been some strong trigger that necessitated strong actions on the part of Russia's rulers; i guess the Moscow "mayoral election of 2013":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_mayoral_election,_2013 has been a deep shock to the establishment and this is what has put them into panic mode;

In these elections opposition parties picked up some 40% of the vote. I guess it showed that at least in Moscow they managed to question the status quo. It is no longer enough to control the media and to rig the election procedure; nowadays social media has a wide reach, grassroots activists can be organized as local election monitors, now this makes vote rigging much more difficult.

In Russian history external threats have most often been used as a pretexts for the tightening of screws at home. Part of this schema is also implemented right now, for example the current wave of restrictions tries to put some limits on bloggers; that is new - they now take them on as a serious threat.

However restrictions alone don't make it. Up until now Putin's authoritarian rule has been legitimized as the return to order that followed the stormy nineteens. However this support might be waning - if the current rulers are perceived as corrupt and as inefficient. This card has been played by a new opposition that has been formed around Navalny. The government is seeking ways to discredit the opposition and to renew its support base. And so they decide to push the Ukraine into political chaos, now they blame Ukrainian liberals for the mess, all with the aim to deter ordinary Russians from a repetition of the same experiments.

h3. alternative explanations

Alexei Venediktov says that Putin wants to leave his mark onto history; I doubt that this is a sufficient explanation as the price tag is very high. Think of capital flight, a worsening of relations with the rest of the world, recession; also the isolation would bring up the need for a realignment towards China - with a possible future dependence upon a potential regional opponent. I think that a rational politician would not risk all that. Such a level of risks can only be justified by the the need to counter a real threat (or a threat that is perceived as being real).

h3. wider implications
 
They also managed to seriously piss off a large number of people in the Ukraine; this does not serve Russian interests well. (however i doubt that Putin and his friends were aiming at soft power, i think they are not familiar with the concept)

I find it surprising that all these actions that are supposed to strengthen the rule of the current establishment are achieving the opposite result: capital flight will cause an economic downturn; with a bad economy people will then raise the question of Putin's legitimacy.

I guess inaction (or rather effortless action, Wu-Wei) were not an option here; as always there is too much at stake for those who are in power ...

If this analysis is true, then Russian objectives are of a limited nature (for now) - this means no ground war. i guess that would be a positive element.

(personally i am glad to be watching at all this from far far away).

A municipal election turn into an important event - on condition that a society is standing at a turning point. The East German municipal elections of 1989 were such a moment (big article in German "here":http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wende_und_friedliche_Revolution_in_der_DDR#Gezielter_B.C3.BCrgerprotest_gegen_Kommunalwahlf.C3.A4lschungen )

I guess that this did not escape Mr. Putin, who was a KGB officer stationed in Dresden. This is often described as an unimportant outpost, whoever Dresden was a center of the opposition movement, so Mr. Putin must be very much aware of all this...
