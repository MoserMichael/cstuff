I have been reading a bit on the subject of propaganda language of totalitarian/authoritarian regimes. (here are my [notes in pdf format](https://github.com/MoserMichael/cstuff/files/3323527/total-language.pdf) ). And so I came across an interesting encyclopedia article by Charlene Tan that defines the term authoritarian indoctrination, as well as its opposite [ link ] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281224135_Indoctrination)  – I think it is noteworthy that the article does not use the term anti-authoritarian education for the opposite concept.

As I understood the meaning of indoctrination: all incoming information has to be understood exclusively by the subject in terms of the main doctrine; also the school system has to actively instill the doctrine and expunge all doubts and heresies. 

Now the problem is that the doctrine is defined as a system of control beliefs, defined as  ‘psychologically strong beliefs that are cherished and integral to a person’s life and personal identity’. Now any system of education is based around a set of control beliefs, a lack of such control beliefs would constitute some kind of vacuum. The opposite of authoritarian indoctrination is define as follows: ‘a healthily enculturated person is allowed and encouraged to inquire into and even revise one’s control beliefs if necessary, as well as to interact with and learn  from other traditions’ - now my problem is that by actively calling control beliefs into question one would invalidate them as such.

I think that there are other possibilities of a middle ground that are not discussed in this short articles: one could try to go for a historical approach – try to explain how core believes and paradigms came about; this could possibly allow to present alternatives without invalidating the ‘core beliefs’

My notes on the article

[ Indoctrination ] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281224135_Indoctrination) by Charlene Tan

Indoctrination – negative term, ‘associated with authoritarian education’, but they had to work hard to define a distinct meaning for ‘education’.  Say hat for ‘indoctrination’ you need a system of ‘control beliefs that promote a totalistic ideology’ (control beliefs := ‘psychologically strong beliefs that are cherished and integral to a person’s life and personal identity  They are usually embraced by the person without question and are most resistant … to change.’) ‘a totalistic ideology severely limits one’s intellectual horizon by constricting the person to a simplistic and binary ‘We versus You’ worldview. Affectively, such an ideology incites an all-or-nothing emotional alignment through intense affection and loyalty for one’s leaders and fellow group members, and a corresponding hostility and hatred towards those outside the group.  What follows in behaviour is a mobilisation of extremist thoughts and destructive emotions to protect one’s ideology, advance its cause and eradicate all obstacles and enemies at all costs.’

Features of an indoctrinated person

    - _indoctrinators strive to isolate their pupils from all factors that challenge their believe systems_ 
	    - they strive to educate a set of core believes that are described as abstract and unchallenged positive value (the capital letter truth)
    - _ all incoming information has to be in alignment with the doctrine: _ ‘these control beliefs determine the person’s identity and control one’s entire life, making the person interpret everything through the lens of the control beliefs. These beliefs stubbornly withstand the external challenge and even distort reality by filtering all incoming stimuli and re-interpreting new information in alignment with and support of one’s control beliefs. This is possible because the control beliefs are fortified by a small but carefully implanted and deeply embedded cluster of intertwined beliefs. ‘ 
    - _everything that does not fit the doctrine is rejected_ ‘an indoctrinated person’s control beliefs screen and censure new inputs that challenge, or are inconsistent with, the existing control beliefs by forming new beliefs to reject them, such as “This thought is from the devil”’
	    - “develops intense affection and loyalty for “Us” and a corresponding hostility and hatred towards “Them”. The end result is that the person, feeling privileged to have been ‘chosen’, is obsessed with removing all hindrances – human and otherwise – to fulfill one’s ‘higher calling’ to protect and propagate one’s ideology.’”


to make it stick with the pupils: all this must be pushed by ”a community of believers who share the same tradition. An indoctrinatory tradition is a discourse or social process that seeks to entrench control beliefs that promote a totalistic ideology”
    - “there must be a deliberate, systematic and sustained process by the indoctrinator(s) to implant control beliefs that advance a totalistic ideology. “
    - “By dogmatically insisting that it has the monopoly of the truth, it trumpets its own infallibility, resists genuine learning from other traditions, and censures alternative worldviews. In the process, it fosters closed-mindedness and undermines the basic social conditions for its members to grow and mature in their thought, emotions and actions. “ “incapacitates its members’ development of strong  rationality and strong autonomy. Such a tradition may grant its members weak  rationality in the sense that they are capable of giving reasons to support their beliefs by assuming the truth of their own tradition. But strong rationality is denied as its  members are prohibited from examining or critiquing the tradition itself, considering alternatives, and learning from other traditions.”


on the opposite of indoctrination:  “ But these (core) beliefs are not held in such an extreme way that they become impervious to doubt. A healthily enculturated person is allowed and encouraged to inquire into and even revise one’s control beliefs if necessary, as well as to interact with and learn  from other traditions. The willingness and ability of a normally enculturated person to  question one’s own beliefs, consider alternatives and order one’s life autonomously  are largely absent in an indoctrinated person; the latter is one who blindly clings on to  a totalistic ideology as the person’s cognitive, affective and behavioural growth has been paralysed. “
