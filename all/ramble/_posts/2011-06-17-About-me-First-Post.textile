My name is Michael Moser; I used to have a home page "long long time ago":http://web.archive.org/web/20031228111524/http://www.michaelmoser.org/ Seems ages now.
Ever since that time a lot of things changed, so this is my somewhat belated comeback as WEB 2.0 
The posts are formatted in wiki-like markup language "Textile":http://redcloth.org , the site is generated by  "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll and the web site template I modified from "Dan Hixon's blog":http://danhixon.github.com  . 
"Github":http://github.com is hosting this stuff. Many thanks to everyone involved.
