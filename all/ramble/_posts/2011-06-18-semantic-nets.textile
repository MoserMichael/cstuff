Man has named child after "a Button":http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13417930 
(At least it is not "this button":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_red_button#Symbolism )
While staying on the subject of Facebook, I wonder if you can automate creation of "semantic nets":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network) by doing statistical analysis of things that people do 'like'.  
In order to do that you would need information kept by both google and facebook; Facebook knows what you 'like' (corresponding to the concepts of a semantic net) Google knows what you have searched for and how you got it (the edges between concepts) / the edges are extracted from query words. Nodes are concepts that you 'liked'. 
Ups now google "has that too":https://plus.google.com
This sort of research would be similar to what they are doing in Natural Language Processing, these days it's all statistics and "n-grams":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram With such an encompassing knowledge system the resulting Knowledge Monopoly (tm) could serve you content aware adds on future thoughts even before you have thought of them.
.. Now there was this recent science fiction idea of the "Singularity event":http://www.amazon.com/dp/0670033847/ being "near":http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2011-02/001293.html - It says that a machine capable of thought will blow away all current technological limitations and we will all shoot out for the stars, and all that should happen Really soon.
Well I don't know, even if the machine comes up with a grand plan, it will depend on the political will of Humans to implement it; so I guess that all the bots will end up sending emails to each other being largely ignored ... Just like us Humans ;-) also we might end up with a "really depressed Marvin":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android
