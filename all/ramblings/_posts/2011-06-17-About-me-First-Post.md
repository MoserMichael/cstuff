My name is Michael Moser; I used to have a home page [long long time ago](http://web.archive.org/web/20031228111524/http://www.michaelmoser.org/) Seems ages now. Ever since that time a lot of things changed, so this is my somewhat belated comeback as WEB 2.0. Now any page/content here on this site may change without warning, just like Wikipedia ;-)

The posts are formatted in wiki-like markup language [Textile](http://redcloth.org) , the site is generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the web site template I modified from [Dan Hixon's blog](http://danhixon.github.com) . [Github](http://github.com) is hosting this stuff. Free comments/discussion boards are hosted by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) . Many thanks to everyone involved.

Also special thanks to the [two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) [inventors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn) and developers of TCP/IP; The [inventor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) of HTTP, and the many thousand workers and developers that deal with the wondrous world of [IP routing and switching](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc.html). The result of their common toil may turn out to be as important as the invention of the [printing press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg)
