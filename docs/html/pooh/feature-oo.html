<h3>Object oriented programming</h3>
<p>The choices here are</p>
<ul>
	<li>Class based with subtype polymorphism.</li>
	<li>Prototype based</li>
</ul>
<p>The first approach creates class types, all instances of data of a given class must in structure to their respective class type.</p>
<p>Prototype based objects &#8211; each object instance is constructed anew, the structure of the instance does not conform to any prescribed features.</p>
<h3>More on classes</h3>
<p>Class based design acts as a schema for the actual data that a program is processing. All object instances have to fit some layout prescribed by a class instance.</p>
<p>I think that the class based design approach can be compared to other software development efforts that require the design of a schema. Usually such a design process involves a level of discipline that can&#8217;t be expected from a person who is just learning to program.</p>
<p>There are many different ways as to how a given system can be partitioned into classes; these designs are also often very brittle, a small change in the requirements can lead to major redesigns of a system.</p>
<p>Normal people (not conditioned by years of programming practice) are no good at growing / maintaining hierarchies of concept.</p>
<p>Usually people try to avoid hierarchies in their daily life, they always try.<br />
Some observations that justify this statement:<br />
     People tend to put all their file on the desktop instead of creating hierarchies of folders.<br />
     Discussion boards: Once upon a time each discussion board had threaded discussions (hierarchies of message as main node- response to given message as child nodes) nowadays this format is not commonly used; it&#8217;s simpler to manage for most people; I think Joel on Software said that first with regards to discussion boards. Once upon a time that was really a very novel view on things.</p>
<h3>Advantages of classes</h3>
<p>The big advantage is that the compiler knows the layout of a class; so it can translate this knowledge into efficient executable code.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that developer environments can offer documentation and auto-completion for a given type and its members.</p>
<p>These are of course things that are of enormous benefit to large software projects.</p>
<h3>Advantages of prototype based approach</h3>
<p>The concept is much simpler to grasp, therefore better suited for an educational programming language.</p>
<p>Many advantages of prototype based approach are listed in the paper &#8220;Self the Power of Simplicity&#8221; by David Ungar, Randal Smith.</p>
<p>I think that process of designing a prototype based system is similar to identifying objects by applying analogy (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=n8m7lFQ3njk">Lecture by Douglas R. Hofstdadter</a> ) ; class based approaches are similar to the attempt to creating rigid classifications, in the sense of Aristotle.</p>
