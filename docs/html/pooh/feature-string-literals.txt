there are many possible choices here, the "wikipedia article on strings":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal explains the many notations for a string literal ; "here documents - multiple line strings":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document explains more about strings that span multiple lines; 

Perl achieves a great degree of expressiveness at the cost of introducing multiple kinds of string literals. 
Perl has

* Quoted string constants
* Literal string constants
* HERE documents
* Barewords count as string constants 
* Quote operator

I guess it is a bit complicated to memorize so many notations, especially if one is new to programming. 

h3. Requirements for string literals 

There are therefore the following requirements for  a string notation. 

* One notation for string constants.
* it should not require any escape sequences, escape sequences are a bit hard to
* a string literal must express multiple line strings, sort of like "Here documents"
* must allow for embedding of code into the string; the result of evaluating the code will be inserted 
into the string.

Escape sequences can be avoided, if the definition of  the HERE document contains a definition of the end of string delimiter; 

h3. String literals for the Pooh language.
A string constant can start with a single ' characters, and must end with the same character.

'this is a string'

'this is a string
that spans two lines'

Or it can start with multiple ' characters, and must end with the same number of characters.

''this is a string too, now I can have a single ' character in the text of the string''

Also one can have an expression embedded in the string

'value of factorial of 10 is [ fact( 10 ) ] a big number'

Here the text within the brackets [ ]  is computed, the result of this computation is inserted into the string.

Now if  we have multiple ' characters for start of string delimiter, then we have multiple brackets as start of expression delimiter.

''value of factorial of 10 is [[ fact( 10 ) ]] a big number'' 

h3. Empty string

This construct is powerful but a bit ambiguous; How do you do an empty string? 
Now we can introduce the " - which will be an empty string.
Or you can call a library function emptystring() which returns an empty string.

h3. Requirements for println function

Often one wants to print a text string followed by a new line; in Perl one does not need a separate println function - it is easy to express a string constant that has a newline at the end; in Pascal one does not have escape sequences, therefore they added the println function that writes a newline.

Also you can have a libraryfunction newline(), which returns a single newline character;
