<p>A thread object is a kind of function references;  makethread turns a function reference into a thread function reference;</p>
<p>What if the function reference has captures / non local references ? One can either</p>
<ul>
	<li>disallow use of such a function reference as thread</li>
	<li>moved the captured references from stack to heap, and capture variables are adjusted to the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the function is called via this reference, then a new interpreter thread is created, the new thread has its own stack. Function parameters are pushed onto the new stack. The new thread stack has a reference to the function object; so that both threads (invoking and created thread) hold a reference to the function object.</p>
<p>When the thread calls the yield function for the first time (or returns a value) , then the invocation of the function reference from calling thread returns the yield/return value.</p>
<p>The calling thread can later call resume  on the function object; this will pass controll back to the thread function; resume can receive an argument, a message from calling thread to new thread; this value will be returned by the yield function, which has been called previously by the new thread. <br />
A thread terminates, when it calls return ; The calling thread can check if the thread is running  by calling</p>
<p>The function object that represents the thread will need to have a reference to the thread (in order to pass values around and resume and stuff)<br />
the thread has a reference to the parent thread + calling function object (in order to pass values around).</p>
<h3>Passing control to the thread</h3>
<p>Controll passes back to thre thread if</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implicitly if generator function is called to produce a value.</li>
	<li>By means of thread object; (in this case the thread can get a message from the calling thread)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Passing value back to creator of the thread</h3>
<p>When a thread Yields a value, or exits, then control is passed back to the invoking thread.</p>
<ul>
	<li>On thread exit the calling function gets the Nil value; on Yield it gets a copy of the expression (if pointer to heap then reference to heap is copied).</li>
	<li>The <span class="caps">FOR</span> loop will use the yielded value and assign it to loop invariant for use in next iteration.</li>
	<li>The thread object can return the yielded value by special accessor function.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Yield control to arbitrary thread</h3>
<p>we don&#8217;t have that here.</p>
