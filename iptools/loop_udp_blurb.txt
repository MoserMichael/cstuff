loop_udp -i <infile> [-s] [-f <filter>] [-n]

Print specific information on all udp packets in input capture file.
It shows the following information
  seq(#) 	  - sequence number
  time(sec.usec)  - time of packet 
  ipv4_src        - source ip
  udp_port 	  - udp port
  ipv4_dst 	  - destination ip
  udp_dst 	  - destination port
  data_len 	  - length of UDP payload
  data		  - hexadecimal dump of UDP payload.

By default, IP fragments are reassembled into packets, this requires that fragments have been
captured and are present in the capture file.

For whatever reason I could not bring tshark to show packet data, so i did my own, by using libpcap;

 -i <infile>	- input capture file
 -s		- don't show header line
 -f <filter>	- filter expression (for syntax see man pcap-filter(7))
 -n		- don't reassemble IP fragments, (default is to reassemble them)
